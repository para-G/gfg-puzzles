Each person can see the hat of all the persons ahead of him in the line, but not those of the people standing behind. Each person is required to guess (loudly) the color of his/her own hat.

What is the maximum number of correct guesses in this strategy? 0\n",

      "Solution:\n",
      "The person who stands last in the queue, behind everyone else, will count the number of white hats on the heads of the 19 people present ahead of him.

He then checks whether the number of white hats in front of him is even or odd. If the number is even, that means the hat on his head is black.

Therefore, the total cases are 7×4- 1(as there is repetition of two boys two times). The possibility for having two boys with both of them taking birth on Tuesday will be 7×2- 1.

If Anesthesia injection is injected in a rat, it will faint in exactly 24 hours. You have 5 rats available to determine which one injection contains the Anesthesia.

Next, we race the 5 level 1 winners (R1C5, R2C5, R3C5, R4C5 and R5C5). Let’s say R1C5 wins this race, R2C5 comes second and R3C5 comes third. The winner of this race (R1C5) is the fastest horse of the entire group. Now, the horse which is second in the entire group can either be R2C5 or R1C4. The horse which is third in the entire group can either be R3C5, R2C4 or R1C3. Therefore, we race these 5 horses. Therefore, the horse R1C5 is the fastest horse. The horses which come first and second in the last race are the horses which are second and third in the entire group respectively. in this way, the minimum number of races required to determine the first, second and third horses in the entire group is 7. \\nThis explanation is provided by Feroz Baig Make group of 5 horses and run 5 races. Suppose five groups are a,b,c,d,e and next alphabet is its individual rank in tis group(of 5 horses).for eg. d3 means horse in group d and has rank 3rd in his group. [ 5 RACES DONE ] \\na1 b1 c1 d1 e1 \\na2 b2 c2 d2 e2 \\na3 b3 c3 d3 e3 \\na4 b4 c4 d4 e4 \\na5 b5 c5 d5 e5 Now make a race of (a1,b1,c1,d1,e1).[RACE 6 DONE] suppose result is a1>b1>c1>d1>e1 \\nwhich implies a1 must be FIRST. \\nb1 and c1 MAY BE(but not must be) 2nd and 3rd. \\nFOR II position, horse will be either b1 or a2 \\n(we have to find top 3 horse therefore we choose horses b1,b2,a2,a3,c1 do racing among them [RACE 7 DONE]. \\nThe only possibilities are : \\nc1 may be third \\nb1 may be second or third \\nb2 may be third \\na2 may be second or third \\na3 may be third \\nThe final result will give ANSWER. suppose result is a2>a3>b1>c1>b2 \\nthen answer is a1,a2,a3,b1,c1. \\nHENCE ANSWER is 7 RACES Please note that the 7 races work for the case also when all top 3 horses are same group or any top two horses are in same group. The group which has top 3 horses would always have winner in 6th race. In 7th race, we consider 2nd and 3rd horses of the group whose horse is overall winner. We also consider 2nd horse of the group whose horse came 2nd in 6th race.

', 'answer': 'A dealer has 1000 coins and 10 bags. He has to divide the coins over the ten bags so that he can make any number of coins simply by handing over a few bags. How must divide his money into the ten bags? Solution: The idea of filling coins in the powers of 2 can be get from the condition that was given the question that each bag can be given or not given, that is we are not allowed to open the bag and give some coins. So we can represent each bag as each place value which takes either the value of 0 or 1. For example if we have to give 7 coins then it is nothing but 0000000111 the last 3 digits of 1 represents that those 3 bags whose place values are 1,2,4 are to be given to give 7 coins. Remember that each bag should be either given or not given that means there are only 2 choices to us, which has similarity with the numbers in base 2 where each digit has only 2 values either 1 or 0.\\nWe can fill coins in the 10 bags in increasing order of 2^n where n varies from 0 – 8, filling the last bag with all remaining coins as follows: 1 = 2^0 = 1 2 = 2^1 = 2 3 = 2^2 = 4 4 = 2^3 = 8 5 = 2^4 = 16 6 = 2^5 = 32 7 = 2^6 = 64 8 = 2^7 = 128 9 = 2^8 = 256 10 = remaining coins = 489 Now, the dealer can make any number of coins just by handing over the bags. As, \\nnumber 0f coins needed = some bag 1 + some bag 2 + ….. + some bag n \\nexample: \\n519 coins = bag 2 + bag 4 + bag 8 + bag 16 + bag 489 Factorization algorithms other than powers of 2 are costly on computer systems.

After you place the balls in the bowls, a random ball will be picked from a random bowl. Distribute the balls (all of them) into the bowls to maximize the chance of picking a white ball. Explanation:\\nFirst, let us assume that we divided the balls into jars equally so each jar will contain 50 balls.\\nSo the probability of selecting a white ball will be=probability of selecting the first jar*probability of white ball in the first jar + probability of selecting the second jar*probability of white ball in the second jar\\n=(1/2)*(0/50)+(1/2)*(50/50)=0.5\\nSince we have to maximize the probability so we will increase the probability of white ball in the first jar and keep the second probability same mean equal to 1\\nso we add 49 white balls with 50 black balls in the first jar and only one white ball in the second jar\\nso the probability will be now= Therefore, probability of getting white ball becomes 1/2*1 + 1/2*49/99 which is approximately 3/4.

If a prisoner tells the correct color, then is saved, otherwise executed. How many prisoners can be saved at most if they are allowed to discuss a strategy before the jailer starts asking colors of their hats. Answer: \\nAt-most 99 prisoners can be saved and the 100th prisoner has 50-50 chances of being executed. \\nThe idea is that every prisoner counts number of red hats in front of him. 100th prisoner says red if the number of red hats is even. He may or may not be saved, but he conveys enough information to save 99th prisoner. The 99’th prisoner decides his answer on the basis of answer of 100’th prisoner’s answer. There are following possibilities and 99’th prisoner can figure out color of his hat in every case. If 100’th prisoner said ‘Red’ (There must have been even number of red hats in front of him) \\na) If 99’th prisoner sees even number of red hats in front of him, then his color is black. \\nb) If 99’th prisoner sees odd number of red hats in front of him, then his color is red.

Develop a strategy for the player making the first turn i.e, Player A, such that he/she never loses the game.', 'answer': 'Puzzle: Consider a two-player coin game where each Player A and Player B gets the turn one by one. There is a row of even number of coins, and a player on his/her turn can pick a coin from any of the two corners of the row. The player that collects coins with more value wins the game. Develop a strategy for the player making the first turn i.e, Player A, such that he/she never loses the game. Note that the strategy to pick a maximum of two corners may not work. In the following example, the first player, Player A loses the game when he/she uses a strategy to pick a maximum of two corners. Example: Solution:\\nThe idea is to count the sum of values of all even coins and odd coins, compare the two values. The player that makes the first move can always make sure that the other player is never able to choose an even coin if the sum of even coins is higher. Similarly, he/she can make sure that the other player is never able to choose an odd coin if the sum of odd coins is higher. So here are the steps to a proper algorithm of either winning the game or getting a tie: Example: Suppose you are given the following rows of coins: Coins at even places: 20, 30, 14\\nCoins at odd places: 18, 15, 10\\nThese places are fixed independent of whether the choice of selection must begin from the left or the right-hand side. Step 1: Sum of all even placed coins = 20 + 30 + 14 = 64\\nStep 2: Sum of all odd placed coins = 18 + 15 + 10 = 43\\nStep 3: Comparing the even and the odd placed coins where EVEN > ODD Therefore, Player A must start selecting from the right-hand side and choose all the even-placed coins every time(here they are 14, 30 and 20). So first picker, Player A picks 14. Now, irrespective of whether the second Player B starts selecting from the left-hand side i.e., 18 or from the right-hand side i.e., 20, the even placed coins i.e., 14, 30 and 20 are booked for the Player A. Therefore, be any situation arise, the first picker Player A will always win the game. Here are the illustrations to both the cases of pick by Player B:\\nCase 1: When Player B starts picking from the left corner. Case 2: When Player B starts picking from the right corner after Player A.

The person wants to transport the maximum number of bananas to a destination which is 1000 KMs away, using only the camel as a mode of transportation. The camel cannot carry more than 1000 bananas at a time and eats a banana every km it travels. What is the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred to the destination using only camel (no other mode of transportation is allowed). Solution: \\nLet’s see what we can infer from the question: With all these points, we can say that person won’t we able to transfer any banana to the destination as the camel is going to eat all the banana on its way to the destination. But the trick here is to have intermediate drop points, then, the camel can make several short trips in between. Also, we try to maintain the number of bananas at each point to be multiple of 1000. Let’s have 2 drop points in between the source and destination. With 3000 bananas at the source. 2000 at a first intermediate point and 1000 at 2nd intermediate point. Source————–IP1—————–IP2———————-Destination 3000       x km        2000     y km           1000          z km ——————–>  |    —————> | ———————–> <——————-    |    <————–  | ——————->    |    —————> | <——————      |                             | ——————->     |                             | Let’s see the total number of bananas consumed at every point. We now try to calculate the distance between the points: So from IP2 to the destination point camel eats 467 bananas. The remaining bananas are 533. So the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred is 533. Another Approach: If the camel doesn’t eat a banana while returning, which means when it doesn’t have a banana, then the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred will be 833. Let us divide the journey into 3 parts. First, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels 333 KMs and puts the remaining bananas (1000-333 = 667) at first intermediate place and returns back to the source. Similarly, two more times, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travel for 333 KMs and put there remaining. Now, the total numbers of bananas are 2001 at the first intermediate place. Again, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels 500 KMs and puts the remaining bananas(1000-500=500) at second intermediate place and returns back to first intermediate place. Similarly one more times, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels for 500 KMs and put there remaining bananas. Now, the total number of bananas is 1000 at the second intermediate place. At last, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels the remaining journey to 167 KMs. Thus, the total number of bananas is 833 at the final destination. So, the maximum number of bananas can be transferred is 833, if the camel doesn’t eat a banana while returning.

Answer:\\nOne year can have only one palindrome as the year fixes the month and date too, so the year has to be less than 2001 since we already have the palindrome for 10/02.

He doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 18 days, how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task? Answer: 16 100% of task = 18 days As he doubles the task everyday. So, 50% of task = 17 days 25% of task = 16 days. Alternative Solution : Let the amount of work the man did on first day be x and total work to be done be S. As the amount of work he did on next day would be 2 times of it’s previous day, we can write amount of work he did on 2nd day as ‘2x’, 3rd day ‘4x’, 4th day ‘8x’ and so on…. We can write it as a GP as follows : S = x+2x+4x+8x+….. (till 18th day) S = x*(218-1)/(2-1)    [Formula of summation of GP S=a(rn-1)/(r-1)] S=x*(218-1)    –   equation (1) According to ques we have to find the day when he would complete 25% of the total work, then ‘S’ becomes ‘S/4’ We can write the expression as S/4 = x+2x+4x+8x+….  (till nth day) S/4=x*(2n-1)/(2-1) S/4=x*(2n-1) Substituting value of S from equation (1) x*(218-1)/4=x*(2n-1) On simplifying 218-1=4*(2n-1) 218-1=2n*4-4 2n+2=218+3    (2n*4=2n*22=2n+2) We can neglect 3 in comparison of 218 2n+2=218 n+2=18 n=16 days So answer is 16 days.

After a few days, S realized that the note is fake, And this railed at C and took 500 Rs back from him. So in this whole process how much money did C loose in the end? Answer: 500\\nExplanation:\\nThe total loss for shopkeeper = 500 ( given back to the person who had provided the change ) Consider a transaction box, the lady came with a counterfeit 500 Rs note which can be considered of 0 value.\\nNow the lady took the item (cost of the item 100 Rs ) and 400 Rs (the change given by shopkeeper(C) to the lady)\\nfrom the transaction box, total of 500 Rs.

What strategy should be used to drop eggs such that total number of drops in worst case is minimized and we find the required floor. We may make a few assumptions: We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 100 droppings.\\nSuppose 2 eggs are available. What is the least number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?\\nThe problem is not actually to find the critical floor, but merely to decide floors from which eggs should be dropped so that total number of trials are minimized. If we use Binary Search Method to find the floor and we start from 50’th floor, then we end up doing 50 comparisons in worst case. The worst case happens when the required floor is 49’th floor.

The objective is for the group to get as many correct guesses as possible. The group is allowed to discuss and form a strategy before the exercise. What is the best strategy? What is the maximum number of correct guesses in this strategy? Solution:\\nThe person who stands last in the queue, behind everyone else, will count the number of white hats on the heads of the 19 people present ahead of him. If this number is even, he (loudly) guesses the hat on his head as ‘Black’. if the number is odd, he guesses ‘White’. The probability of the hat on his head being what he guessed is 50%. There is no way this person can guess the hat on his head correctly. However, his guess functions as a message to others in front of him. Suppose the 20th person guesses ‘Black’. Now, the person who is 19th in the queue knows that the number of white hats on the first 19 people (the 18 people in front of him and himself) is even. He then checks whether the number of white hats in front of him is even or odd. If the number is even, that means the hat on his head is black. If the number is odd, that means the hat on his head is white and calls that out (loudly). Therefore, the 19th person in the queue always guesses correctly, based on the message the 20th person passed on. A similar strategy is followed by each person in turn. Therefore, everyone except the last (20th) person guesses correctly for sure. The answer to this puzzle, therefore, is 19. This puzzle is contributed by Feroz Baig.

When the mother says that at least one of the two children has a muddy forehead, she is stating that the disjunction s ∨ d is true.\\nBoth children will answer “No” the first time the question is asked because each sees mud on the other child’s forehead.

But different from them, here is one puzzle for you with no ambiguity.', 'answer': 'The Boy or Girl problem consists of a bunch of questions in probability which has kept the mathematicians on discussion about its possibilities.  But different from them, here is one puzzle for you with no ambiguity. Suppose that I have a friend whose name is Ankur. Ankur has his elder brother who got married 10 years before. But Ankur being a silly guy has the habit of forgetting things; you can say a “Short time memory loss”. This summer he is going to meet his brother after 10 years, and he has planned to purchase some clothes for his brother’s kids as a token of love. Each and every time he faces a problem he comes to me, so this time also, he came to seek help, and I have not left him empty handed. I told him that as far as I can recall, his brother has two offspring’s and one of the boy was born on Tuesday. Now, it’s your turn to help him.  What is the probability that Ankur’s brother has two boys? Assume an equal chance of giving birth to either sex and an equal chance to giving birth on any day. Solution: If you think the answer should be 1/2, you would be wrong. If you knew which child was a boy (say, the younger one), you would be closer to the truth.But since the boy could be either the younger or the older child, the analysis is more subtle. The answer would be 13/27. There can be four cases, i.e. either his brother has two boys, or one boy(elder) and one girl, one girl(elder) and one boy, or both of them are girls. And there are 7 equally likely possibilities for any one of the children of taking birth on Tuesday for all these four cases. Therefore, the total cases are 7×4- 1(as there is repetition of two boys two times). The possibility for having two boys with both of them taking birth on Tuesday will be 7×2- 1. Therefore, the answer would be 13/27. The things can be made more clear from the image shown below. This article is contributed by Praveer Satyam.
