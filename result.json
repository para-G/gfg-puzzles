Can you guess what are the ages of three daughters? Answer:\n1) Product of ages is 72 Below are all possibilities to get 72 from product of three different ages: 1 * 1 * 72 = 72 1 * 2 * 36 = 72 1 * 3 * 24 = 72 1 * 4 * 18 = 72 1 * 6 * 12 = 72 1 * 8 * 9 = 72 2 * 2 * 18 = 72 2 * 3 * 12 = 72 2 * 4 * 9 = 72 2 * 6 * 6 = 72 3 * 3 * 8 = 72 3 * 4 * 6 = 72 2) Sum of the ages is given 1 + 1 + 72 = 74 1 + 2 + 36 = 39 1 + 3 + 24 = 28 1 + 4 + 18 = 23 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 1 + 8 + 9 = 18 2 + 2 + 18 = 22 2 + 3 + 12 = 17 2 + 4 + 9 = 15 2 + 6 + 6 = 14 3 + 3 + 8 = 14 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 All sums are unique except 14.

If Anesthesia injection is injected in a rat, it will faint in exactly 24 hours. You have 5 rats available to determine which one injection contains the Anesthesia. How do you achieve this in 48 hours ? ", "answer": "In a Medical Laboratory, you have 240 Injections, one of which is for Anesthesia for a rat. If Anesthesia injection is injected in a rat, it will faint in exactly 24 hours. You have 5 rats available to determine which one injection contains the Anesthesia. How do you achieve this in 48 hours ? Solution: \nLet us number the each injection with unique 5 digit numbers consisting of only 0, 1 and 2. Let us number the Rats as 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. The action corresponding to the digit in the unit place will be executed by rat numbered 1. The action corresponding to the digit in the tenth place will be executed by rat numbered 10. The action corresponding to the digit in the 100th place will be executed by rat numbered 100. The action corresponding to the digit in the 1000th place will be executed by rat numbered 1000. The action corresponding to the digit in the 10000th place will be executed by rat numbered 10000. Number 0 on an Injection represents that the injection will not be injected to rat. \nNumber 1 on an Injection represents that the injection will be injected to rat on 1st day. \nNumber 2 on an Injection represents that the injection will be injected to rat on 2nd day (after 24 hours). Example: Let us say the Injection is numbered 11201. The Injections is injected on the first day to rat numbered 10000, 1000 and 1. It is injected on the second day to rat numbered 100. And it is not injected to rat numbered 10. So if the rats numbered 10000, 1000 and 1 faint within first 24 hours, rat numbered 100 faints in the next 24 hours and the rat numbered 10 does not faint, then the Anesthesia Injection has to be 11201. Total number of injections that can be tested in this way will be: So with the help of 5 rats and within 48 hours we will be able to find a Anesthesia Injection among 243 Injections.

You can conduct race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out how many races are required to get the top 3 horses. ", "answer": "There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. You can conduct race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out how many races are required to get the top 3 horses. The solution is 7. First, we group the horses into groups of 5 and race each group in the race course. This gives us 5 races (see image below). In the image, each row represents one race of 5 horses. For convenience, let us name the horses using row and column index. Therefore, the first race(row 1) was contested between the horses R1C1, R1C2, R1C3, R1C4 and R1C5. The second race (row 2) was contested between the horses R2C1, R2C2 and so on. Let us assume that the fifth member of each row won the race (R1C5 won the first race, R2C5 won the second race and so on), the fourth member of each row came second (R1C4 came second in the first race, R2C4 came second in the second race and so on) and the third member of each group came third (R1C3 came third in the first race, R2C3 came third in the second race and so on). Next, we race the 5 level 1 winners (R1C5, R2C5, R3C5, R4C5 and R5C5). Let\u2019s say R1C5 wins this race, R2C5 comes second and R3C5 comes third. The winner of this race (R1C5) is the fastest horse of the entire group. Now, the horse which is second in the entire group can either be R2C5 or R1C4. The horse which is third in the entire group can either be R3C5, R2C4 or R1C3. Therefore, we race these 5 horses. Therefore, the horse R1C5 is the fastest horse. The horses which come first and second in the last race are the horses which are second and third in the entire group respectively. in this way, the minimum number of races required to determine the first, second and third horses in the entire group is 7. \nThis explanation is provided by Feroz Baig Make group of 5 horses and run 5 races. Suppose five groups are a,b,c,d,e and next alphabet is its individual rank in tis group(of 5 horses).for eg. d3 means horse in group d and has rank 3rd in his group.

The group which has top 3 horses would always have winner in 6th race. In 7th race, we consider 2nd and 3rd horses of the group whose horse is overall winner.

", "answer": "A dealer has 1000 coins and 10 bags. He has to divide the coins over the ten bags so that he can make any number of coins simply by handing over a few bags. How must divide his money into the ten bags? Solution: The idea of filling coins in the powers of 2 can be get from the condition that was given the question that each bag can be given or not given, that is we are not allowed to open the bag and give some coins. So we can represent each bag as each place value which takes either the value of 0 or 1. For example if we have to give 7 coins then it is nothing but 0000000111 the last 3 digits of 1 represents that those 3 bags whose place values are 1,2,4 are to be given to give 7 coins. Remember that each bag should be either given or not given that means there are only 2 choices to us, which has similarity with the numbers in base 2 where each digit has only 2 values either 1 or 0.\nWe can fill coins in the 10 bags in increasing order of 2^n where n varies from 0 \u2013 8, filling the last bag with all remaining coins as follows: 1 = 2^0 = 1 2 = 2^1 = 2 3 = 2^2 = 4 4 = 2^3 = 8 5 = 2^4 = 16 6 = 2^5 = 32 7 = 2^6 = 64 8 = 2^7 = 128 9 = 2^8 = 256 10 = remaining coins = 489 Now, the dealer can make any number of coins just by handing over the bags.

After you place the balls in the bowls, a random ball will be picked from a random bowl. Distribute the balls (all of them) into the bowls to maximize the chance of picking a white ball. Explanation:\nFirst, let us assume that we divided the balls into jars equally so each jar will contain 50 balls.\nSo the probability of selecting a white ball will be=probability of selecting the first jar*probability of white ball in the first jar + probability of selecting the second jar*probability of white ball in the second jar\n=(1/2)*(0/50)+(1/2)*(50/50)=0.5\nSince we have to maximize the probability so we will increase the probability of white ball in the first jar and keep the second probability same mean equal to 1\nso we add 49 white balls with 50 black balls in the first jar and only one white ball in the second jar\nso the probability will be now= Therefore, probability of getting white ball becomes 1/2*1 + 1/2*49/99 which is approximately 3/4.

There is a row of even number of coins, and a player on his/her turn can pick a coin from any of the two corners of the row. The player that collects coins with more value wins the game. Develop a strategy for the player making the first turn i.e, Player A, such that he/she never loses the game. Note that the strategy to pick a maximum of two corners may not work. In the following example, the first player, Player A loses the game when he/she uses a strategy to pick a maximum of two corners. Example: Solution:\nThe idea is to count the sum of values of all even coins and odd coins, compare the two values. The player that makes the first move can always make sure that the other player is never able to choose an even coin if the sum of even coins is higher. Similarly, he/she can make sure that the other player is never able to choose an odd coin if the sum of odd coins is higher. So here are the steps to a proper algorithm of either winning the game or getting a tie: Example: Suppose you are given the following rows of coins: Coins at even places: 20, 30, 14\nCoins at odd places: 18, 15, 10\nThese places are fixed independent of whether the choice of selection must begin from the left or the right-hand side. Step 1: Sum of all even placed coins = 20 + 30 + 14 = 64\nStep 2: Sum of all odd placed coins = 18 + 15 + 10 = 43\nStep 3: Comparing the even and the odd placed coins where EVEN > ODD Therefore, Player A must start selecting from the right-hand side and choose all the even-placed coins every time(here they are 14, 30 and 20). So first picker, Player A picks 14. Now, irrespective of whether the second Player B starts selecting from the left-hand side i.e., 18 or from the right-hand side i.e., 20, the even placed coins i.e., 14, 30 and 20 are booked for the Player A. Therefore, be any situation arise, the first picker Player A will always win the game. Here are the illustrations to both the cases of pick by Player B:\nCase 1: When Player B starts picking from the left corner. Case 2: When Player B starts picking from the right corner after Player A.

We now try to calculate the distance between the points: So from IP2 to the destination point camel eats 467 bananas. The remaining bananas are 533. So the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred is 533. Another Approach: If the camel doesn\u2019t eat a banana while returning, which means when it doesn\u2019t have a banana, then the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred will be 833. Let us divide the journey into 3 parts. First, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels 333 KMs and puts the remaining bananas (1000-333 = 667) at first intermediate place and returns back to the source. Similarly, two more times, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travel for 333 KMs and put there remaining. Now, the total numbers of bananas are 2001 at the first intermediate place. Again, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels 500 KMs and puts the remaining bananas(1000-500=500) at second intermediate place and returns back to first intermediate place. Similarly one more times, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels for 500 KMs and put there remaining bananas. Now, the total number of bananas is 1000 at the second intermediate place. At last, the camel takes 1000 bananas and travels the remaining journey to 167 KMs. Thus, the total number of bananas is 833 at the final destination. So, the maximum number of bananas can be transferred is 833, if the camel doesn\u2019t eat a banana while returning.

A person walks through all doors multiple times and toggle (if open then close, if close then open) them in following way: In first walk, the person toggles every door In second walk, the person toggles every second door, i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, \u2026 In third walk, the person toggles every third door, i.e. 3rd, 6th, 9th, \u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026 \n\u2026\u2026\u2026. In 100th walk, the person toggles 100th door. Which doors are open in the end? Solution: \nA door is toggled in ith walk if i divides door number. For example the door number 45 is toggled in 1st, 3rd, 5th, 9th ,15th and 45th walk.\nThe door is switched back to an initial stage for every pair of divisors. For example, 45 is toggled 6 times for 3 pairs (5, 9), (15, 3) and (1, 45). \nIt looks like all doors would become closes at the end. But there are door numbers which would become open, for example, 16, the pair (4, 4) means only one walk. Similarly all other perfect squares like 4, 9, \u2026.

Answer: 16 100% of task = 18 days As he doubles the task everyday. So, 50% of task = 17 days 25% of task = 16 days. Alternative Solution : Let the amount of work the man did on first day be x and total work to be done be S. As the amount of work he did on next day would be 2 times of it\u2019s previous day, we can write amount of work he did on 2nd day as \u20182x\u2019, 3rd day \u20184x\u2019, 4th day \u20188x\u2019 and so on\u2026.

(till nth day) S/4=x*(2n-1)/(2-1) S/4=x*(2n-1) Substituting value of S from equation (1) x*(218-1)/4=x*(2n-1) On simplifying 218-1=4*(2n-1) 218-1=2n*4-4 2n+2=218+3    (2n*4=2n*22=2n+2) We can neglect 3 in comparison of 218 2n+2=218 n+2=18 n=16 days So answer is 16 days.

What is the maximum number of runs that a batsman can score in an ideal case ? Note:\u201dHere we assume ideal and little practical scenario. We assume that batsman can not run for more than 3 runs in a ball, as otherwise there is no limit, he can run infinite runs(theoretically) in a ball, as far as opposite team does not catch the ball.\u201d Answer: 49*(6*5+3)+(6*6)= 1653 From Over 1 to 49: 1st ball:- 6 runs(hit six) 2nd ball:- 6 runs(hit six) 3rd ball:- 6 runs(hit six) 4th ball:- 6 runs(hit six) 5th ball:- 6 runs(hit six) 6th ball:- 3 runs(took 3 runs between the wickets and take back the strike) = >49*(6*5+3) 50th Over: Hit six sixes in a row. = >6*6 This article is contributed by Vikash Kumar.

Can you answer following questions? Assume that both the players are intelligent enough. Solution:\nO will win the game. The sixth mark was X in square 9.\n\n \nExplanation:\nThe 7th mark must be placed in square 5 which is the win situation for both X and O. Hence, the 6th mark must be placed in a line already containing two of the opponents marks. There are two such possibilities \u2013 the 6th mark would have been either O in square 7 or X in square 9. As we know both the players are intelligent enough, the 6th mark could not be O in square 7. Instead, he would have placed O in square 5 and would have won. Hence, the sixth mark must be X placed in square 9. And the seventh mark will be O.

Note: It is allowed to flip the coins of one pile once.\n  \nAnswer: Make 2 piles with 10 coins and 90 coins each.

The objective is for the group to get as many correct guesses as possible. The group is allowed to discuss and form a strategy before the exercise. What is the best strategy? What is the maximum number of correct guesses in this strategy? Solution:\nThe person who stands last in the queue, behind everyone else, will count the number of white hats on the heads of the 19 people present ahead of him. If this number is even, he (loudly) guesses the hat on his head as \u2018Black\u2019. if the number is odd, he guesses \u2018White\u2019. The probability of the hat on his head being what he guessed is 50%. There is no way this person can guess the hat on his head correctly. However, his guess functions as a message to others in front of him. Suppose the 20th person guesses \u2018Black\u2019. Now, the person who is 19th in the queue knows that the number of white hats on the first 19 people (the 18 people in front of him and himself) is even. He then checks whether the number of white hats in front of him is even or odd. If the number is even, that means the hat on his head is black. If the number is odd, that means the hat on his head is white and calls that out (loudly). Therefore, the 19th person in the queue always guesses correctly, based on the message the 20th person passed on. A similar strategy is followed by each person in turn. Therefore, everyone except the last (20th) person guesses correctly for sure. The answer to this puzzle, therefore, is 19. This puzzle is contributed by Feroz Baig.

Assume that both children are honest and that the children answer each question simultaneously. Solution: Let s be the statement that the son has a muddy forehead and let d be the statement that the daughter has a muddy forehead. When the mother says that at least one of the two children has a muddy forehead, she is stating that the disjunction s \u2228 d is true.\nBoth children will answer \u201cNo\u201d the first time the question is asked because each sees mud on the other child\u2019s forehead. That is, the son knows that d is true, but does not know whether s is true, and the daughter knows that s is true, but does not know whether d is true.\nAfter the son has answered \u201cNo\u201d to the first question, the daughter can determine that d must be true. This follows because when the first question is asked, the son knows that s \u2228 d is true, but cannot determine whether s is true. Using this information, the daughter can conclude that d must be true, for if d were false, the son could have reasoned that because s \u2228 d is true, then s must be true, and he would have answered \u201cYes\u201d to the first question. The son can reason in a similar way to determine that s must be true. It follows that both children answer \u201cYes\u201d the second time the question is asked.

But different from them, here is one puzzle for you with no ambiguity.", "answer": "The Boy or Girl problem consists of a bunch of questions in probability which has kept the mathematicians on discussion about its possibilities.  But different from them, here is one puzzle for you with no ambiguity. Suppose that I have a friend whose name is Ankur. Ankur has his elder brother who got married 10 years before. But Ankur being a silly guy has the habit of forgetting things; you can say a \u201cShort time memory loss\u201d. This summer he is going to meet his brother after 10 years, and he has planned to purchase some clothes for his brother\u2019s kids as a token of love. Each and every time he faces a problem he comes to me, so this time also, he came to seek help, and I have not left him empty handed. I told him that as far as I can recall, his brother has two offspring\u2019s and one of the boy was born on Tuesday. Now, it\u2019s your turn to help him.  What is the probability that Ankur\u2019s brother has two boys? Assume an equal chance of giving birth to either sex and an equal chance to giving birth on any day. Solution: If you think the answer should be 1/2, you would be wrong. If you knew which child was a boy (say, the younger one), you would be closer to the truth.But since the boy could be either the younger or the older child, the analysis is more subtle. The answer would be 13/27. There can be four cases, i.e. either his brother has two boys, or one boy(elder) and one girl, one girl(elder) and one boy, or both of them are girls. And there are 7 equally likely possibilities for any one of the children of taking birth on Tuesday for all these four cases. Therefore, the total cases are 7\u00d74- 1(as there is repetition of two boys two times). The possibility for having two boys with both of them taking birth on Tuesday will be 7\u00d72- 1. Therefore, the answer would be 13/27. The things can be made more clear from the image shown below. This article is contributed by Praveer Satyam.
